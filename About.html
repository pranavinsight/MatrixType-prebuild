<section align=center><h1>Keyboards, the Matrix made in Buttons of Tech</h1></section>
<p>Keyboards are important for computing the system. For each button, it sends the command to the PC and the PC sends the code that it Received from the Keyboard to the Monitor and the monitor outputs the code as the text, functions or even characters and emojis(may vary depending on the models or types of Keyboard).<br>We have many, many types of Keyboards. More about them in the Keyboards Section. Keyboards are very cool. Especially, gaming Keybards are very cool because of their rgb lights and their feel while typing on the Keyboard. There are also Keyboard world records. For example, World's Biggest Keyboard & Mouse, World's Shortest Keyboard(yes, and mouse), World's Fastest Keyboard.etc.<br>Now, Mister AI will talk more about Keyboards with a little-twist of humour.</p>
<h1>The Evolution of Keyboards: A Whimsical Journey ⌨</h1>
<h2>Introduction 🌟</h2>
<p>The keyboard, that trusty companion of our digital adventures, has a fascinating backstory. From clunky typewriters to sleek computer peripherals, it has evolved more than a Pokémon during an intense battle. So, fasten your seatbelts (or rather, your wrist rests), as we embark on this delightful journey through time. 🚀</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: The Typewriter Era 🕰️</h2>
<p>Our tale begins in the late 1800s when Christopher Latham Sholes patented the first practical modern typewriter. Imagine a room filled with industrious typists, their fingers dancing across the keys like caffeinated spiders. These early typewriters were mechanical beasts, demanding Herculean strength to press each key. But they birthed the QWERTY layout, a quirky arrangement designed to prevent jamming. It’s like Sholes said, “Let’s make typing feel like a cryptic crossword puzzle!” 🕵️‍♂️</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Transition to Computing 🌐</h2>
<p>As the digital age dawned, the keyboard shed its mechanical skin and donned an electronic cloak. Teletypes, those distant cousins of typewriters, paved the way. Charles Krum, our unsung hero, tinkered between 1907 and 1910 to make teletypes practical for everyday use. These machines combined the elegance of Morse code with the brute force of a sledgehammer. Result? A keyboard that could send messages across continents faster than a caffeinated pigeon. 📠🏹</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Technological Milestones 🚀</h2>
<p>The 1930s saw keyboard models that merged typewriters with telegraphs. Imagine a lovechild of a typewriter and a telegram operator—efficient, mysterious, and slightly melodramatic. Punch-card systems (the ancestors of calculators) joined the party. IBM, the life of the tech soirée, raked in over a million dollars in adding machine sales by 1931. Keypunches danced their way into early computers, like the 1946 ENIAC, which used punch cards for input and output. It was like a waltz of ones and zeros. 💃🔢</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: Modern Keyboards 💻</h2>
<p>Fast-forward to today. Our keyboards have slimmed down, ditching the typewriter’s beer belly. They’re whisper-quiet, unlike their ancestors that clattered like a herd of caffeinated tap dancers. We’ve got ergonomic designs, backlit keys, and even customizable RGB lighting. Because nothing says “productivity” like a rainbow wave across your WASD cluster. 🌈⌨️</p>

<h2>Conclusion 🎉</h2>
<p>And there you have it—the evolution of keyboards, from clunky typewriters to sleek tech marvels. So, next time you type a witty tweet or a heartfelt email, remember the ghosts of typists past. And if your keyboard ever acts up, just whisper, “QWERTY, I choose you!” 🌟🍌</p>
